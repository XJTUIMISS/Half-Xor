![gcc](https://img.shields.io/badge/gcc-8.1.0-yellow) ![mmh3](https://img.shields.io/badge/mmh3-3.0.0-blue)


This repository includes our realization of Half-Xor, which can be used to estimate the number of distinct values (i.e. NDV) in a column of big tables when both insert and delete happens. Though several previous sketch methods (e.g. [HyperLogLog Sketch](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf)) have been proposed, they cannot or are costly to manage fully-dynamic scenarios where data is frequently inserted into and deleted from the table. Our Half-Xor sketch consists of a compact bit matrix and a small counter array, and it needs to set a few bits and update a counter when handling a data insertion/deletion. Compared with the mergeable state-of-the-art method, our experimental results demonstrate that our method Half-Xor is up to 6.6 times more accurate under the same memory usage and reduces the memory usage by up to 16 times to achieve the same estimation accuracy.

### Datasets

We involve synthetic datasets, real world datasets and TPCH, TPCDS benchmarks in our experiments. For synthetic datasets, we first generate ùëõ distinct integers drawn from 64-bit integer space without replacement. Then for every one of these ùëõ elements, we duplicate it ùëò times, where ùëò is a random variable chosen from {1, 2, 3, . . . , 10} uniformly at random. Then we insert all the duplicated data values into column ùëé of table ùëá. Besides, all the primary key column values in table ùëá are sampled from 64-bit integer space without replacement. 

For real-world datasets, we use the databases from the relational database repository, which can be accessed through

To compile the codes, use:

```shell
make hll-fd
make hll-pro
make half-xor
```

Besides, we implement the three estimates based on Half-Xor. The Half-Xor-EZ, Half-Xor-IVW are in Half-Xor.cpp and Half-Xor-ML in Half-Xor-ML/*.
